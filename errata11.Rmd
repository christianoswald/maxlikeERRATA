## Section 11.4.1-3

In definition 11.1 we define $F(t)$ as $Pr(Y^*\leq t)$ but then, in the definition of the survival function, we use $T$ (instead of $Y^*$), where T is defined further up the page.  To be consistent the $T$ in the survival function (11.1) should be  $Y^*$.

On page 228-229:  After defining the Weibull Accelerated Failure Time model, let $u_i ~ EV_1$ and $\sigma$ be parameterized as $1/p$.

On page 229, in the definition of the Weibull distribution in the section ``In case you were wondering'':  $E[T]$ should be $\lambda*\Gamma(1+1/p)$   (not plus).
