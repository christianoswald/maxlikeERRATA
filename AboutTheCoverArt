Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri is an Aboriginal artist, born into a nomadic Pintupi tribe, among the last to encounter Euro-Australians. His images are abstract representations of sacred stories. This painting by depicts designs associated with the salt lake site of Wilkinkarra (Lake Mackay) in Western Australia. In mythological times two ancestral Tingari men travelled to Wilkinkarra from the soakage water site of Marawa in the west. When the men arrived at Wilkinkarra they lit a large fire in order to flush out the malu (kangaroo) that they were hunting. They later entered the earth and continued their travels underground towards the east.
